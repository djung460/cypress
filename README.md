### Cypress API (Temp.)
## Keep Track of your Solutions

Made out of neccesity got tired of Googling the same thing over and over.

Lightweight way to keep track of solutions.

## Planned Requirements
- Users with accounts can write solutions or is it steps? (I dunno...) I'll
  come up with a name soon.

- Guests and users can view eachother's solutions

- Solutions must be able to be written in markdown

- Solutions must be associated with a problem or task eg.

- Solutions must belong to a category

- Categories are user generated
